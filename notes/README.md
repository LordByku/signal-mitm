# Notes

This directory contains notes by the student such as lab notebooks, weekly reports, etc.

Whenever you perform experiments, create a new *lab notebook file* `lab-notebook-YYYY-MM-DD` by copying the [template](./template-lab-notebook.md).

Before each weekly meeting, create a *weekly report* `weekly-report-YYYY-MM-DD` by copying the [template](template-weekly-report.md).
After the meeting, fill in the agreed-upon tasks for the next week.
