\label{ch:related-work}

% This is different from the background:
% While the background contains systems that you build on, the related work contains systems that try to solve the same or a similar problem as the thesis.
% * Analyze research landscape, how does the work fit in?
% * Present work that others may think to be related and explain why it isn't related
