Thesis Evaluation

The evaluation is divided into four parts which are graded independently and counted equally.
The criteria in each part can have different importance and weights and can also differ based on the type of the project (research or implementation focus).


Work Practice

Background and Reading	The student has a good overview and understanding of relevant literature, which they studied extensively, and was eager to learn important skills for the project.
Problem Analysis	The student was able to analyze problems very well and identify important subproblems.
Overcoming Problems, Proposal of Solutions	The student was always able to propose good solutions to problems that arose during the project and overcome obstacles.
Realization of Solutions	Once a solution was identified, the student worked out the details effectively and efficiently.
Organization of Work	The student organized their work in such a way that both their work and the supervision were efficient.
Independent Working	The student worked independently and only needed input from the supervisor for significant problems.
Engagement & Motivation	The student was highly motivated and always enthusiastic to engage in discussions.
Quality of Discussions	The student was well prepared for meetings and discussions which were therefore very productive.
Acting on Feedback	After receiving feedback, the student showed clear improvement or clearly argued why changes were unnecessary or impossible.


Results

Research Quality	"This criterion can differ substantially depending on the project. Some examples:
- The projects main objectives were achieved and the results' quality warrants a publication in a top conference of the field.
- Although the project was unsuccessful, this negative result was obtained through extensive and thorough research which ruled out possible solutions.
- An implementation project clarifies and improves the previously available design and provides important evaluation for the related research."
Code Quality	The code is well structured, written clearly, and follows applicable coding conventions.
Code Documentation	The code is fully documented such that it can be understood and modified easily by other individuals.


Report

Completeness	The report contained all necessary parts, i.e., introduction, background, results, implementation (if applicable), analysis / evaluation, discussion, related work, conclusion. All relevant results of the project are presented in the report.
Structure	All parts of the report were structured in a way that is well suited for the reader to understand the project's goals, setup, and results.
Interpretation of Results	The interpretation of results, in particular in the discussion, provides important insights into the topic and places the thesis well among related work.
Clear argumentation	The student's arguments are easy to follow and use clear logic.
Terminology and notation	Terminology and notation is appropriate, introduced clearly, and used consistently throughout the report.
Literature & Citations	All relevant literature is mentioned and cited properly.
Language & Presentation	"The student uses clear and concise language without typographic and grammatical errors	 all figures are clear, well labeled and helpful for the understanding of the results."


Presentation

Structure	The presentation's structure was well suited for the audience to understand the project's goals, setup, and results.
Style / Appearance	"The student presented the content in such a way that it was easy to follow the presentation	 slides and other visual aides were designed to be helpful for the audience."
Q & A / Technical Insight	During the Q&A session after the presentation, the student showed a thorough understanding of the field by engaging in discussions and concisely answering questions.
