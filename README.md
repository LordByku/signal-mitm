# Minion in the Middle

Welcome! This is an open source framework aimed at security researchers to facilitate conducting man-in-the-middle attacks against end-to-end encrypted messaging applications.

While this repository currently focusses on the open-source Signal Messenger, we plan to extend it to more applications in the future.
